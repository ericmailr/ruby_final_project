Command line Chess where two players can play against each other. A simple AI that performs random legal moves was also programmed if you don't have an opponent to play with. Coded with Ruby. RSpec was used to create a series of tests. Players also have the option of saving a game's progress (data serialized with YAML). *There currently is no castling implemented.
